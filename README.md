### II. Financial Context

Home Depot's financial performance is a key indicator of its market position and operational efficiency. The company generates revenue through retail sales in its stores and online platforms. It also offers installation services and tool rentals. Home Depot's financial health is influenced by various factors, including consumer spending, housing market trends, and seasonal demand fluctuations. The company's ability to manage its inventory, optimize supply chain operations, and maintain cost control are critical to sustaining its profitability and growth.

### III. Business Scenario- Predicting Quarterly Revenue

In the competitive retail landscape, accurate revenue forecasting is crucial for strategic planning and resource allocation. For Home Depot, predicting quarterly revenue can help optimize inventory levels, manage staffing, and plan marketing campaigns effectively. Traditional financial analysis provides insights into past performance, but integrating machine learning models can enhance predictive accuracy and provide forward-looking insights.

### IV. Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict Home Depot's quarterly revenue based on historical financial data and relevant economic indicators. This predictive model will assist Home Depot in making data-driven decisions, improving operational efficiency, and maximizing profitability.

### V. Model Selection

To achieve this objective, I will consider several machine learning models and evaluate their performance to select the best-fit model for predicting quarterly revenue. The models I will consider include:

**1. Linear Regression:**

- Simple and interpretable model that can capture linear relationships between the features and the target variable.
Suitable for initial baseline predictions.

**2. Random Forest:**

- An ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting.
- Handles non-linear relationships and interactions between features effectively.

**3. Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost):**

-An advanced ensemble technique that builds trees sequentially to correct the errors of the previous trees.
- Known for its high predictive accuracy and ability to handle complex data patterns.

**4. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):**

- A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting.
- Can capture temporal dependencies and trends in the data over multiple time periods.

### VI. Steps to Develop the Models

**1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

- Collect historical financial data from Home Depot's 10-K reports, including revenue, expenses, and other relevant financial metrics.
- Supplement this data with economic indicators such as consumer confidence, housing starts, and interest rates.
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

- Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify trends, and detect any anomalies or outliers.
- Visualize key metrics to gain insights into the factors influencing Home Depot's revenue.

**3. Feature Engineering:**

- Create features that capture important patterns and relationships in the data.
- Include lagged variables, growth rates, seasonal indicators, and economic indicators as features.

**4. Model Development:**

- Develop and train the selected machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LSTM) on the training data.
- Evaluate model performance using cross-validation and metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

**5. Model Evaluation and Selection:**

- Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing model based on validation metrics.
- Ensure the selected model generalizes well to unseen data.

### VII. Data & Data Extraction Process

The `data/` directory contains the CSV files extracted from Home Depot's 10-K reports. These files include key financial statements and other relevant data used for analysis and model development.

### XI- Conclusion & Recommendations

This project successfully identified and developed a predictive model for Home Depot's quarterly revenue. After extensive analysis and comparison of various models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM, the Linear Regression model was selected for its superior performance and interpretability. The model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 17,098.37 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 17,306.38, indicating its effectiveness in predicting revenue with reasonable accuracy.

Key insights from the model results reveal that the predicted revenue follows the general trend of the actual revenue, but there are discrepancies, especially in capturing the peaks and troughs. This suggests that while the model is reasonably good at identifying the overall direction of revenue changes, it struggles with accurately predicting the exact revenue values for each quarter. This discrepancy might be due to the inherent limitations of the Linear Regression model in capturing non-linear patterns in the data.

The performance metrics further underscore the need for more sophisticated models or additional features that better capture the dynamics of quarterly revenue. Despite these limitations, the Linear Regression model provides a baseline understanding and a foundation for further refinement and improvement.

Given the model's performance, it is clear that while linear regression offers a straightforward and interpretable approach, there is room for improvement. Additionally, incorporating more features, such as economic indicators or market trends, could enhance the model's predictive power. Regularly updating the model with new data and continuously monitoring its performance will ensure its relevance and accuracy over time.

By leveraging these insights, Home Depot can make more informed, data-driven decisions to optimize operations, enhance efficiency, and maximize profitability. This project's methodology and findings contribute valuable insights into the application of machine learning models in financial forecasting, showcasing the potential for predictive analytics in the financial industry.
