## XGBoost Analysis

### I. Introduction

XGBoost is an advanced ensemble technique that builds trees sequentially to correct the errors of the previous trees. Known for its high predictive accuracy and ability to handle complex data patterns, XGBoost is widely used for its efficiency and performance.

### II. Steps

#### a) Data Preprocessing

- Standardization of features: Ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the model by bringing them to a common scale.
- Handling missing values: Ensuring the dataset is complete and ready for modeling by addressing any missing data points.

#### b) Model Training

Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search: Fine-tuning the model by searching through a specified hyperparameter space to find the best combination of parameters that result in the most accurate predictions.

#### c) Hyperparameters

**Number of boosting rounds:**

- [100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000]
- Determines the number of iterations or trees the model will build. More rounds can improve accuracy but also increase the risk of overfitting and the training time.

**Learning rate:**

- [0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2]
- Controls the contribution of each tree to the final model. Lower rates slow down the learning process but can lead to better performance.

**Maximum depth of a tree:**

- [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
- Sets the maximum depth of each tree. Deeper trees can capture more information but can also lead to overfitting.

**Minimum sum of instance weight (hessian) needed in a child:**

- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- Controls the minimum number of samples required to form a new node in the tree. Higher values prevent overfitting by making the trees more generalized.

**Minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node:**

- [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
- Also known as gamma, it determines the minimum loss reduction needed to split a node. It helps in pruning the tree by preventing unnecessary splits.

**Subsample ratio of the training instances:**

- [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]
- Defines the fraction of samples to be used for training each tree. Subsampling helps prevent overfitting and makes the training process faster.

**Subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree:**

- [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0]
- Specifies the fraction of features to be used in each tree. Column subsampling adds randomness to the model and helps improve generalization.

**L1 regularization term on weights:**

- [0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1]
- Adds a penalty for larger absolute values of weights, encouraging sparsity and reducing overfitting.

**L2 regularization term on weights:**

- [0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1]
- Adds a penalty for larger squared values of weights, helping to prevent overfitting by smoothing the model.

#### d) Performance Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 29184.10
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 39088.65

### III. Interpretation

The XGBoost model, though not the top performer in my comparison, showcased its ability to capture complex patterns within the data. The model's Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 29184.10 signifies the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual revenue values, providing a direct understanding of prediction errors in monetary terms. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 39088.65 reflects the model's tendency to penalize larger errors more severely, offering a comprehensive measure of prediction accuracy.

The tuning process involved adjusting various hyperparameters such as the learning rate, number of estimators, and regularization terms, which helped enhance the model's performance and stability. The insights derived from feature importance analysis revealed which variables most significantly influenced Home Depot's quarterly revenue predictions, allowing us to understand key drivers of the company's financial performance.

Overall, the XGBoost model's performance underscores its robustness and flexibility in handling diverse and complex datasets, making it a valuable tool for predictive analytics in financial contexts.
