## Long Short-Term Memory Analysis

### I. Introduction

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly effective for time series forecasting. LSTM networks are capable of learning and remembering over long sequences, making them suitable for capturing temporal dependencies in data.

### II. Steps

**a) Data Preprocessing**

- Standardization of features: Ensures that all features have a similar scale, which helps the model converge faster and improves performance.
- Handling missing values: Involves filling in or removing missing data to ensure the dataset is complete and can be used for training.

**b) Model Architecture**

- Layers: The model consists of LSTM layers followed by Dense layers. The LSTM layers capture the temporal dependencies in the data, while the Dense layers combine the features learned by the LSTM layers to make final predictions.
- Activation Functions: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is used for the hidden layers to introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to learn more complex patterns. The output layer does not use an activation function, as it is a regression task.

**c) Model Training**

- Number of Epochs: 100. An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset.
- Batch Size: 16. The batch size is the number of training samples used to update the model weights in one iteration.

**d) Key Concepts of the LSTM Model**

- Units: In LSTM layers, the units parameter specifies the number of LSTM units (neurons) in the layer. More units can capture more complex patterns but increase computational complexity.
  
- Dropout: A regularization technique to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training.

- Dense: Fully connected layers that combine features learned by previous layers to make final predictions.

- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): An activation function that outputs the input directly if it is positive; otherwise, it outputs zero. It helps the model learn complex patterns.

- Adam Optimizer: An optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent: AdaGrad and RMSProp. It is efficient and requires little memory.

- Mean Squared Error Loss: A common loss function for regression tasks, calculating the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.

- Early Stopping: A technique to prevent overfitting by stopping training when the model's performance on a validation set starts to deteriorate. The parameters include:
- monitor='val_loss': Monitors the validation loss.
- patience=10: Number of epochs with no improvement after which training will be stopped.
- restore_best_weights=True: Restores the model weights from the epoch with the best value of the monitored quantity.

### III. Performance Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 45503.82
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 58693.71

### IV. Interpretation

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 45503.82 indicates that on average, the LSTM model's revenue predictions are off by approximately $45,503.82. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 58693.71 provides a measure of the model's prediction accuracy, giving more weight to larger errors. In the context of my project, these metrics suggest that while the LSTM model captures some of the temporal patterns in Home Depot's quarterly revenue data, there is still a significant margin of error, indicating room for improvement in the model's accuracy.
