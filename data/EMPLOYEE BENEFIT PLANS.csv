Retirement Benefits [Abstract], 
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS,"EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS We maintain active defined contribution retirement plans for our associates (the “Benefit Plans”). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. We make cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates’ contributions as approved by our Board of Directors. We also maintain the Restoration Plans to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code. We fund the Restoration Plans through contributions made to grantor trusts, which are then used to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market. The following table presents our contributions to the Benefit Plans and the Restoration Plans: in millions Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2023 2022 2021 Contributions to the Benefit Plans and the Restoration Plans $ 293 $ 280 $ 278 At January 28, 2024, the Benefit Plans and the Restoration Plans held a total of 5.0 million shares of our common stock in trusts for plan participants."
