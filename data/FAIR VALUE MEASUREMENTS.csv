Fair Value Disclosures [Abstract], 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS,"FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: • Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; • Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and • Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring management judgment to develop the Company’s own models with estimates and assumptions. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis The following table presents the assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: January 28, 2024 January 29, 2023 in millions Fair Value (Level 2) Fair Value (Level 2) Derivative agreements – assets $ — $ — Derivative agreements – liabilities (859) (778) Total $ (859) $ (778) The fair values of our derivative instruments are determined using an income approach and Level 2 inputs, which primarily include the respective interest rate forward curves and discount rates. Our derivative instruments are discussed further in Note 5 . Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Long-lived assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets are subject to nonrecurring fair value measurement for the assessment of impairment. We did not have any material assets or liabilities that were measured and recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, or fiscal 2021. Other Fair Value Disclosures The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
