Segment Reporting [Abstract], 
SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES,"SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES We currently conduct our retail operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, each of which represents one of our three operating segments. Our operating segments reflect the way in which internally-reported financial information is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, who is our President and Chief Executive Officer, to analyze performance, make decisions and allocate resources. For disclosure purposes, we aggregate these three operating segments into one reportable segment due to the similar nature of their operations and economic characteristics.
