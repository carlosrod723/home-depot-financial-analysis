Business Combination and Asset Acquisition [Abstract], 
ACQUISITIONS,"ACQUISITIONS During fiscal 2023, we completed three individually immaterial acquisitions for total aggregate cash purchase consideration of $1.5 billion . Based on preliminary acquisition date fair values, we recognized aggregate definite-lived intangible assets of $469 million with a weighted average amortization period of 17 years, primarily related to customer relationships, and goodwill of $998 million. The goodwill arising from the acquisitions is primarily attributable to operational synergies and acceleration of growth strategy, as well as the assembled workforce. The portion of goodwill generated through these acquisitions that is expected to be deductible for U.S. federal and state tax purposes is not material. We have completed preliminary valuation analyses necessary to assess the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the amount of goodwill to be recognized as of the acquisition dates. These fair values were based on management’s estimates and assumptions; however, the amounts indicated above are preliminary in nature and are subject to adjustment as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed as of the respective acquisition dates. Accordingly, there may be adjustments to the assigned values of acquired assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to, intangible assets and their respective estimated useful lives. The final determination of the fair values and related income tax impacts will be completed as soon as practicable, and within the measurement period of up to one year from the respective acquisition dates as permitted under GAAP. Any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period will be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment is determined."
