SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Policies),12 Months Ended
,"Jan. 28, 2024"
Accounting Policies [Abstract], 
"Business, Consolidation and Presentation","The Home Depot, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (the “Company,” “Home Depot,” “we,” “our” or “us”), is a home improvement retailer that sells a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, décor products, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations products, in stores and online. We also provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rental. We operate in the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico.Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation."
Fiscal Year,Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31 st . All periods presented include 52 weeks.
Use of Estimates,"We have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with GAAP. While we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates."
Cash and Cash Equivalents,Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.
Receivables,Card receivables consist of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit card and debit card transactions. Rebate receivables represent amounts due from vendors for volume and co-op advertising rebates. Customer receivables relate to credit extended directly to certain customers in the ordinary course of business.
Merchandise Inventories,"Inventory cost includes the amount we pay to acquire inventory, including freight and import costs, as well as operating costs and depreciation associated with our sourcing and distribution network, and is net of certain vendor allowances. The majority of our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, as determined by the retail inventory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail operations in Canada and Mexico, and distribution centers, record merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, as determined by a cost method, primarily the first-in, first-out method. These merchandise inventories represent approximately 38% of the total merchandise inventories balance. We evaluate the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the adjustments recorded to merchandise inventories valued under a cost method were not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. Physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in merchandise inventories are properly stated. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. We calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results."
Property and Equipment,"Buildings and related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter."
Capitalized Software Costs,"We capitalize certain costs, including interest, related to construction in progress and the acquisition and development of software. Costs associated with the acquisition and development of software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which ranges from three"
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,"We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. Long-lived assets with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the asset group’s fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Impairment losses on property and equipment are recorded as a component of SG&amp;A."
Leases,"We enter into contractual arrangements for the utilization of certain non-owned assets which are evaluated as finance or operating leases upon commencement, and are accounted for accordingly. Specifically, a contract is or contains a lease when (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and (2) we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration. We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. Our leases include certain retail locations, warehouse and distribution space, office space, equipment, and vehicles. A substantial majority of our leases have remaining lease terms of one The discount rate used to calculate the present value of lease payments is the rate implicit in the lease, when readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable, we use a secured incremental borrowing rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis, as the discount rate for the present value of lease payments. Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and operating expenses applicable to the leased asset are generally our obligations under our lease agreements. In instances where these payments are fixed, they are included in the measurement of our lease liabilities, and when variable, they are excluded and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Certain of our lease agreements also include rental payments based on an index or rate, and others include rental payments based on a percentage of sales. For variable payments dependent upon an index or rate, we apply the active index or rate as of the lease commencement date. Variable lease payments not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of our lease liabilities, as they cannot be reasonably estimated, and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Leases that have a term of twelve months or less upon commencement are considered short-term in nature. Short-term leases are not included on the consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have also elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of assets including real estate and certain equipment."
Business Combinations,The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,"Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired. We do not amortize goodwill, but assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each fiscal year, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed periodically or as facts and circumstances warrant."
Supplier Finance Programs,"We have a supplier finance program whereby we have entered into payment processing agreements with several financial institutions. Under these agreements, the financial institutions act as our paying agents with respect to accounts payable due to certain suppliers. Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, elect to receive payment for one or more of our payment obligations, prior to their scheduled due dates, at a discounted price from participating financial institutions. We are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the program, and our rights and obligations to our suppliers are not impacted. We do not reimburse suppliers for any costs they incur for participation in the program. We have not pledged any assets as security or provided any guarantees as part of the program. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decisions to participate in the program. Our responsibility is limited to making payment to the respective financial institution according to the terms originally negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier elects to receive early payment from the financial institution. The payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers are consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 30 to 60 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. Our outstanding payment obligations under our supplier finance program"
Debt,"We record any premiums or discounts associated with an issuance of long-term debt as a direct addition or deduction to the carrying value of the related senior notes. We also record debt issuance costs associated with an issuance of long-term debt as a direct deduction to the carrying value of the related senior notes. Premium, discount, and debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest rate method."
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,"We use derivative instruments in the management of our interest rate exposure on long-term debt and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only; we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recognized at their fair values in either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and are classified as either current or non-current based on each contract’s respective maturity. While we enter into master netting arrangements, our policy is to present the fair value of derivative instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair values for derivative instruments designated as cash flow or net investment hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, which for net investment hedges is upon sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investment. Changes in fair value of outstanding fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in fair values of the hedged item are recognized in earnings. We record realized gains and losses from derivative instruments in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item."
Self-Insurance Reserves,"We are self-insured for certain losses related to general liability (including product liability), workers’ compensation, employee group medical, and automobile claims. We recognize the expected ultimate cost for claims incurred (undiscounted) at the balance sheet date as a liability. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates. We also maintain cybersecurity and privacy liability insurance coverage to help limit our exposure to losses such as those that may be caused by a significant compromise or breach of our data security, as well as property loss coverage. Our self-insurance liabilities, which are included in accrued salaries and related expenses, other accrued expenses, and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, were $1.4 billion at January 28, 2024, and $1.3 billion at January 29, 2023."
Treasury Stock,"Treasury stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders’ equity at cost. We use the weighted average purchase cost to determine the cost of treasury stock that is reissued, if any. Excise taxes incurred on share repurchases represent direct costs of the repurchase and are recorded as a part of the cost basis of the shares within treasury stock."
Revenue Recognition,"We recognize revenue, net of expected returns and sales tax, at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or when a service is performed. Our liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels and our expectation of future returns. We also recognize a return asset, and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales, for our right to recover the goods returned by the customer, measured at the former carrying amount of the goods, less any expected recovery cost. At each financial reporting date, we assess our estimates of expected returns, refund liabilities, and return assets. Services revenue is generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance, and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and we provide or arrange for professional installation. These programs are offered through our stores, online, and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when we provide or arrange for the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. We recognize services revenue when the service for the customer is complete, which is not materially different from recognizing the revenue over the service period as the substantial majority of our services are completed within one week. For products and services sold in stores or online, payment is typically due at the point of sale. When we receive payment before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale or service is complete. Such performance obligations are part of contracts with expected original durations of typically three months or less. As of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, deferred revenue for products and services was $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. We further record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize the associated revenue upon the redemption of those gift cards, which generally occurs within six months of gift card issuance. As of both January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, our performance obligations for unredeemed gift cards were $1.1 billion. Gift card breakage income, which is our estimate of the portion of our outstanding gift card balance not expected to be redeemed, is recognized in net sales and was immaterial in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021. We also have agreements with third-party service providers who directly extend credit to customers, manage our PLCC program, and own the related receivables. We have evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated. The agreement with the primary third-party service provider for our PLCC program expires in 2028, with us having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the existing receivables at the end of the agreement. Deferred interest charges incurred for our deferred financing programs offered to these customers, interchange fees charged to us for their use of the cards, and any profit sharing with the third-party service providers are included in net sales."
Cost of Sales,"Cost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to our distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from our stores or distribution network to customers; and the operating cost and depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network. Vendor allowances that are not reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs are also included within cost of sales."
Vendor Allowances,"Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period, which generally concludes at the end of the calendar year, based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold."
"Selling, General and Administrative","Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits for retail and store support center associates, occupancy and operating costs of retail locations and store support centers, insurance-related expenses, advertising costs, credit and debit card processing fees, and other administrative costs."
Advertising Expense,"Advertising costs, including digital, television, radio and print, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Certain co-op advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors’ products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense."
Stock-Based Compensation,"We are currently authorized to issue incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and deferred shares to certain of our associates and non-employee directors under certain stock incentive plans. We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to associates and non-employee directors based on estimated fair values. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense, on a straight-line basis, over the requisite service period or as restrictions lapse. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating stock-based compensation expense. Additional information on our stock-based payment awards is included in Note 9 ."
Income Taxes,"Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We provide for federal, state, and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and SG&A, respectively, on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return which includes certain eligible subsidiaries. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in our consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. For unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we are required to make an assertion regarding reinvestment or repatriation for tax purposes. For any earnings that we do not make a permanent reinvestment assertion, we recognize a provision for deferred income taxes. For earnings where we have made a permanent reinvestment assertion, no provision is recognized. See Note 6 for further discussion. We are subject to global intangible low-taxed income tax, an incremental tax on foreign income. We have made an accounting election to record this tax in the period the tax arises."
Comprehensive Income,"Comprehensive income includes net earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings and recognized within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of equity, which consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Accumulated other comprehensive loss also includes net losses on cash flow hedges that were immaterial as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023. Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings were immaterial in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021."
Foreign Currency Translation,"Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the period, and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction."
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements,"ASU No. 2022-04. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, “Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,” to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs used by an entity in connection with the purchase of goods and services. The standard requires entities that use supplier finance programs to disclose the key terms, including a description of payment terms, the confirmed amount outstanding under the program at the end of each reporting period, a description of where those obligations are presented on the balance sheet, and an annual rollforward, including the amount of obligations confirmed and the amount paid during the period. The guidance does not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. ASU No. 2022-04 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the required rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. On January 30, 2023, we adopted ASU No. 2022-04 with no impact to our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. ASU No. 2020-04. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,” which provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. ASU No. 2020-04 was effective as of March 12, 2020 and may be applied to contract modifications and hedging relationships from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. This guidance was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,” which was effective upon issuance in December 2022 and extended the temporary relief provided by Topic 848 through December 31, 2024. During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we amended our existing fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements, which were designated as fair value hedges, to transition the variable component of such agreements from LIBOR to SOFR. Concurrent with these amendments, we elected certain of the optional expedients provided in Topic 848, which allow us to maintain our designation of fair value hedge accounting and application of the shortcut method for these agreements. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements ASU No. 2023-07. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The disclosure requirements included in ASU No. 2023-07 are required for all public entities, including entities with a single reportable segment. ASU No. 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance is required to be applied on a retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statement disclosures. ASU No. 2023-09. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which requires disclosure of disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as disclosures on income taxes paid by jurisdiction. ASU No. 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance is required to be applied on a prospective basis, with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statement disclosures. Recent accounting pronouncements adopted or pending adoption not discussed above are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows."
