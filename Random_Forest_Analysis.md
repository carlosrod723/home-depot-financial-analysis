## Random Forest Analysis

### I. Introduction

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting. This approach helps in capturing the variability in the data and enhances the robustness of the model.

### II. Steps

#### a) Data Preprocessing

- Standardization of features: Ensures that each feature contributes equally to the model by bringing them to a common scale.
- Handling missing values: Ensures the dataset is complete and ready for modeling by addressing any missing data points.

#### b) Model Training

Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search: Fine-tunes the model by searching through a specified hyperparameter space to find the best combination of parameters that result in the most accurate predictions.

#### c) Hyperparameters

The full list of hyperparameters used for tuning includes:

- Number of trees in the forest: [100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000]
- Number of features to consider at each split: ['auto', 'sqrt', 'log2']
- Maximum depth of the tree: [None, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
- Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node: [2, 5, 10, 15, 20]
- Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node: [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
- Method of selecting samples for training each tree: [True, False]

#### Performance Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 25735.33
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 35224.06

### Interpretation

The Random Forest model provided valuable insights into the importance of various features in predicting Home Depot's quarterly revenue. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 25735.33 indicates the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, representing the typical prediction error in millions of dollars. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 35224.06, which gives more weight to larger errors, measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values. These metrics demonstrate the model's predictive accuracy, with the lower values indicating better performance. The hyperparameter tuning helped in optimizing the model, making it more accurate while avoiding overfitting. The feature importances highlight the impact of different variables on the revenue predictions, offering insights into the key drivers of Home Depot's sales performance.
